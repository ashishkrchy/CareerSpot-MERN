## ‚≠ê Overview

Career Spot is a robust, full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) application designed to revolutionize the job search and recruitment process for both job seekers and companies.

> **The Problem:** In today's dynamic job market, both job seekers and recruiters face significant challenges. Job seekers often struggle with fragmented platforms, difficulty tracking applications, and limited visibility into job statuses. Companies, on the other hand, grapple with inefficient posting mechanisms, a lack of centralized applicant management, and cumbersome processes for hiring the right talent. This often leads to missed opportunities, administrative burdens, and a less-than-optimal hiring experience for all parties involved.

Career Spot provides an elegant, all-in-one solution by offering a centralized, intuitive platform where job seekers can effortlessly discover and apply for jobs, manage their profiles, and track applications, while companies and administrators can efficiently post listings, manage company profiles, and streamline the applicant review process. It fosters a seamless connection between talent and opportunity, making career advancement more accessible and recruitment more efficient.

This project is built as a **monorepo**, meticulously separating the `backend` (Node.js/Express.js API) and `frontend` (React.js application with Vite) components. It leverages a **RESTful API** for seamless communication between the client and server, utilizing **MongoDB** for flexible data storage. User-uploaded content, such as resumes and profile pictures, is efficiently managed via **Cloudinary**, ensuring robust media handling. The architecture emphasizes modularity, scalability, and maintainability, providing a solid foundation for future enhancements.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

*   **Node.js**: v18.x or higher (LTS recommended)
*   **npm** or **Yarn**: (npm comes with Node.js, Yarn can be installed globally via npm)
*   **MongoDB**: A running instance of MongoDB (local or cloud-based like MongoDB Atlas).
*   **Cloudinary Account**: Required for media storage. Sign up at [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) if you don't have an account.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ashishkrchy/ashishkrchy-CareerSpot-MERN-c468df7.git
    cd ashishkrchy-CareerSpot-MERN-c468df7
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup:**
    Navigate into the `backend` directory, install dependencies, and configure environment variables.

    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
    ```

    Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add the following environment variables. Replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials:

    ```env
    PORT=5000
    MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
    CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
    CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
    CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
    JWT_SECRET=a_strong_secret_key_for_jwt # Generate a strong, random string
    FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173 # Adjust if your frontend runs on a different port/domain
    CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5173 # Adjust if your frontend runs on a different port/domain
    ```

3.  **Frontend Setup:**
    Navigate into the `frontend` directory, install dependencies, and configure environment variables.

    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    npm install
    ```

    Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory and add the following environment variable, pointing to your backend API:

    ```env
    VITE_BACKEND_API_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:5000/api/v1 # Ensure this matches your backend PORT
    ```

## üîß Usage

After completing the installation steps, you can run both the backend and frontend services.

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    Open a new terminal window, navigate to the `backend` directory, and start the server:

    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm start
    ```
    The backend server will typically run on `http://localhost:5000` (or the `PORT` you configured in your `.env` file).

2.  **Start the Frontend Development Server:**
    Open another terminal window, navigate to the `frontend` directory, and start the development server:

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm run dev
    ```
    The frontend application will typically run on `http://localhost:5173`.

3.  **Access the Application:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`. You can now sign up as a new user, log in, browse jobs, post jobs (if logged in as an admin/company), and explore all the features of Career Spot.
